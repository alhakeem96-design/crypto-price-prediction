# Crypto-price-prediction
Machine learning project analysing cryptocurrency market data to predict price trends using time-series and predictive modelling techniques

## Overview
This project applies machine learning and time-series analysis techniques to cryptocurrency market data in order to explore and predict price trends.

It was developed as an academic ICT project as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science, with a focus on real-world financial data and predictive modelling.

## Dataset
The project uses historical cryptocurrency market data, including:
- Price (open, close)
- Trading volume
- Market indicators
- Time-based features

The data was sourced and processed to support time-series forecasting tasks.

## Methods Used
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering for time-series data
- Machine learning models for price prediction
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- matplotlib

## Key Outcomes
- Analysed historical cryptocurrency trends
- Built predictive models to estimate future price movements
- Gained experience working with time-series data and financial datasets
- Strengthened understanding of applied machine learning workflows
